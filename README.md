# live_env_stability_feedback
This project was created to change lights at home when some env is on fire. 

Before you start, you need to enable #LAN_CONTROL on your devices as in (here)[https://www.yeelight.com/faqs/lan_control] This will allow the application to discover the bulbs. 

What this application does is basically discover all the eBulbs in the house with lan control enabled and then change them from whatever colour they are into a flashing red/yellow colour for 5 iterations, then return them into white. 

Some of the cases depending on how fast you change the colouds, or how many times you do it, your light goes unresponsive, you just need to turn the light off manually and turn it again and that fix the problem.

# Important
This code is comes with no waranty and the author (me) cannot be liabe for any issues regarding this code and your lights. So feel free to play at your own risk.
